        <div id="box-1">Cleaning the dust from your glasses <br>Ever tried cleaning the dust from your heart? <br>Washing the eyes twice and thrice,
           <br> What about the lust you carry in your mind? -Dikku</div>
        <div id="box-2">You remember last night when you said no? <br>You left the lame and pained hands of mine. <br> You left me when I was so in
            need of yours. <br> The roots which helped you to grow in every single stage of your life,  <br> and how it was easy for
            you to leave me in a time? <br> You remember when you were a little boy and I without your father tried to make everything
            available for you. <br> Never let you know any pain of mine ? <br> Now my pale face, shrinked skin and dark age has the
            need of the bridge to walk till my salvation. <br> Your mom needs you!! -Dikku

        <div id="box-3">I wish I could fill so much love in people, <br> so when if in future i would ask for water <br> they would bring me the shake. - Dikku</div>
